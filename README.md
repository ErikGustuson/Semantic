# Semantic

During this project we were giving a web page that did not meet accessiblility standards and were tasked with adding the semantic HTML elements to correct.  We were also asked to do some refactoring through both HTML and CSS files.

## Major Changes

* Corrected indentation
* Updated to semantic elements
* Renamed classes and ids to allow removal of repetitive code

## Built With

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
